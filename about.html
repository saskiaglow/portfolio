  <div id="index" style="text-align: left;"><br><br>Hey! Right now I'm living in New Haven, biking around and going to Yale for an MFA in Graphic Design. Before that, I was living in Philadelphia, working odd-jobs, biking around, and making projects with my friends and on my own. Before that, I was living in Poughkeepsie, in the Hudson Valley in New York, going to Vassar College for an undergrad degree in American Studies, as well as hosting a podcast, taking a lot of dance workshops, and biking around. Before that, I was living in Weehawken, New Jersey and being a teenager in NYC. <br><br>I'm interested in bodily labor, transit infrastructure, the Gothic, alternate realities, swimming in pools, swimming in the ocean, gummy candy, deception, exhaustion, dark chocolate, cowboy kitsch, grapefruit, satire, mirrors, earthworks, reading a screen, reading without reading, fairy tales, apocalypse, longing, embarrassment, and exhuberance.<br><br></div>
