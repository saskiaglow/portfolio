<div id="work-info">Logo design, powerpoint, and speech for parafictional skincare brand "Optime" as part of a <em>Truth Summit</em> performance with Michael Ipsen. Performed at Icebox Project Space in Philacelphia in a program curated with Ipsen. June 4, 2022. ↓</div>

  <p>I know that everyone in this room has looked in the mirror and hated their skin. What the skincare industry offers is a promise to end that emotional rollercoaster. But what it delivers is an endless cycle I’m sure we’re also familiar with: a go-to regimen your skin suddenly rejects. You add a new moisturizer or cleanser to your routine; maybe you get decent results for a few weeks; and then inevitably, mysteriously, your products fail you again and the cycle restarts.<br><br>
  What if I told you that that process is over? Today, right now, we possess the technology to tailor skincare to the unique chemistry of every single person in this room, in this city, on this earth. I am thrilled to announce the rollout of an exciting new brand at the vanguard of what personal care can be.</p>
<p>Using microscopic nanotechnology with acute machine-learning capabilities, our serums read your face to work with your distinct beauty on a molecular level. Each serum is connected back into our specially developed app, allowing you to track the products’ gradual reformulation across your regimen in one central hub as they get to know you better over time. These are expert-tailored and dermatologist-recommended. And they bring you your optimal skin. This is Optime. Smart skincare for smarter skincare.</p>
<p>I’m here to tell you exactly how we will move forward into this glowing future, one that’s already with us. You’ll come away from today with the tools you need to place Optime front and center in commercial retail spaces and influencer spheres. Our line of products will power the rejuvenation of our current redundant, saturated beauty circuit, using bold innovation that’s not afraid to take risks to provide the best care. Welcome to the next phase of beauty.</p>
<p>If so many of the everyday objects you use in your home have smart components, why not your skincare? At Optime, we look forward to the complete integration of artificial intelligence that looks after your wellbeing, for a total smart life. It’s time to face the music: technology has ascended organic matter. It is better than nature. Get ready to leave behind the inconsistency and lackluster results of homeopathic herbalism; Optime uses organic compounds beyond their original capacities. Product and skin work together to reformulate into the best expressions of themselves—a symbiotic relationship. Let Optime help you glow from within, because health is beauty.</p>
<p>So how will the roll-out actually work?<br>
Optime is aimed at people who know that looks get you where you’re going—people who care. Our adaptive technology lets the brand appeal to anyone looking to revamp their relationship to their skin, since the products themselves change in response to what each consumer needs. Optime is for people not afraid to let technology into their lives in deep integration. So we’re looking to appeal to younger generations who’ve grown up with a high level of routine Internet socialization, as well as older Millennials who’ve embraced the ease in quality-of-life that comes with a smart home. Older women, tired of running the gamut of anti-aging products that fail them again and again, can also find a home with Optime. For us, though, gender, race, and age are obsolete: our artificial intelligences can morph their mediums into serums that are right for anyone, matching scent and color effortlessly.</p>
<p>Targeting a consumer base that has embraced the benefits of biotechnological development allows us to foster unique relationships with our clients. We know what people want, and that’s to feel empowered, to be agents of change who know how the world really works. People want to be connected. Our company promises seamless integration with the accelerating interconnectivity of mind, body and technology in personal life. And we can do that by tugging the threads of our common desires towards our collective vision, braiding them together for the actualization of true beauty in a world of tomorrow that is now. We manage those underlying drives towards the stronger role artificial intelligence deserves in collaboration with human organics. This is in service of greater control.</p>
  <p>We tap into the higher truth of humanity’s impulse towards enlightenment. It vibrates through everything we do. Can you feel it?</p>

<p>You have to work on the hierarchy of the elements—the eye had to know where to go, and right now there’s no direction.<br><br>But I love you anyway.</p>
<p>You can’t say that you care about me and keep flirting with me but then not have hard conversations about what you actually want. That’s lying to everyone involved, me and your partner and yourself. Like what the heck.<br><br>But I love you anyway.</p>
<p>You have to make the figure recede or come forward in space, because right now it’s just flat, it’s just shape, there’s no dimensionality.<br><br>But I love you anyway.</p>
<p>You have to tell me this stuff before it’s too late! I have to know what kind of terms I’m standing on!<br><br>But I love you anyway.</p>
<p>Okay so these colors are too close together in hue, they vibrate against each other so you can’t actually see the edges of the forms, it just becomes abstraction in that moment and maybe you want that effect, fine, but if you’re trying to pull this forward it’s not going to work.<br><br>But I love you anyway.</p>
<p>You can’t tell me you’re gonna show up for me and then not give me the in-between stuff, you can’t just ghost out on me when it gets important and you’re like, oh, I’m really lonely I need support right now, and I’m here offering you support. I get needing to be lost on your own, totally, that’s real, but if we have this connection, what else is it for? That’s what it’s for.<br><br>But I love you anyway.</p>
<p>I like the graphic aspect to this, with the outline, sort of a drawing mark, but if you’re gonna do it you have to make sure it doesn’t become a gimmick, and if you know I have this pattern and you feed into it, or I have a hard time avoiding it, you know I’m gonna wanna outline what’s going on and it comes out of my previous work trying to merge those disciplines. As much as I want to leave it open-ended, I only have so many tools. I don’t know if we can approach any of these as finished works.<br><br>But I love you anyway.</p>

  <p>[start in Robe and towel toga]<br>
[hand gesture] Among mortal women, know this: from every care you could release me.
I need you to help me remember:<br>
[Make towel column]<br>
When Cathy went crazy, in Wuthering Heights, did she rend her pillows, feathers everywhere? Did Heathecliffe try to catch them?<br>
[drape towel on stool pedestal]<br>
[“notice” feathers and pretend to catch them]<br></p>
<p>
[Remove and re-put Robe in loop, slow and fast]<br>
When Athena saw herself spied, at the river, did she cover herself first, or her lover? The peeping, wandering shepherd’s own mother.<br>
[discard Robe]<br>
[dance - covering eyes, open body]<br></p>
<p>
[Make drink]<br>
When Temperance sips the eternal waters, up through the toes and into the twin goblets, pouring, pouring, pouring forever, is it salty? I feel like that water is salty. Or really, really soft.<br>
I would not think to touch the sky with 2 arms<br>
[pause - bar stretch]<br>
[look out gesture]<br>
What is there beyond the ocean’s line? What is there behind the sky?<br>
[toast]<br>
Winged Nike gave out<br>
laurels to rest on.<br>
She was also called Victory.
[pour out drink as libation]<br>
<p>
[dance - look for drink - knee hand foot skim circles]<br></p>
<p>
[put feathers to make wings on arms]<br>
There’s a kid in a huge pair of Angel wings, in the club, in that video, real feathers, it’s hard not to knock into people but they’ll give you a wide berth.<br>
[dance - put on imaginary stockings]<br>
Put the heart in my chest on wings<br>
Beautiful, he stirs up still things<br>
[Sing song from John Bernd, setting up glasses]<br>
[Play glasses instrument]</p>
<p>[stuff glasses w feathers] Forever I am washing the dishes,<br>
forever opening the back door <br>
to see what the night looks like.<br>
[pour tonic and water on head]<br>
[speech]</p>
<p>Undamaged I pray you grant my brother to arrive here.<br>
And all that in his heart he wants to be, make it be.<br>
And all the wrong he did before, loose it.<br>
And let there exist for us not one single further sorrow.<br></p>
<p>
I have to get ready for this party.<br>
[Put tights on legs and arms/head]<br>
A ferry is a kind of chariot,<br>
kind of,<br>
ramparts rampant and spangled.<br>
You would be willing, slight, to be carried.<br> 
And yes, I shall love, as long as there is in me, will be a care.<br>
[Undress, back to audience]<br>
[throw feathers, try to catch them]<br></p>
